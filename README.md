# GoodData-ACME-Demo

Demonstration files used in the GoodData Live! Webinar series plus resources.

The 'ACME' demo is meant to represent a fairly generic company that purchases,
markets and sells things, and that will evolve as the Webinar series progresses.

Check the Git tags/releses to obtain the configuration for a specific webinar episode.
